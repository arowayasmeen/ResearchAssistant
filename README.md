# ResearchAssistant
We aim to advance the Auto-research framework by developing a comprehensive Research Writing Assistant that streamlines the scientific research process. This system supports literature retrieval, gap analysis, idea brainstorming, summarization, passage generation, and proofreading, enhancing productivity without replacing human authorship.

Users input a research prompt and upload relevant documents, while an advanced LLM curates 
state-of-the-art literature and performs gap analysis to pinpoint novel research directions. The system then 
synthesizes bullet points, summaries, and visualizations to generate an initial LaTeX draft, which is further refined 
for enhanced clarity, persuasiveness, and compliance with publication formats.
